# CSC412 Variational Autoencoders

This report contains the code used to train and test our various VAEs in vae.ipynb

The folders contain the trained pytorch models to be used for testing and generating results.
./Digit_Model contains the models of all the trained models trained on the MNIST Digital dataset
./Fashion_model contains the models of all the trained models trained on the MNIST Fashion dataset

In each folder there are 4 files model_ followed by the type of model it uses.
model_deep refers to the deep VAE 
model_simple refers to the simple VAE
model_conv refers to the convolutional VAE
model_trad refers to the traditional AE
